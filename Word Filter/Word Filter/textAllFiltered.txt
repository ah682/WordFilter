First, some ****ground. Since much of the book is about the consequences of ****, it is necessary to begin with some kind of working definition of the term (the grim duty of any writer of introductions). As most readers will be aware, '****' is a notoriously amorphous concept. Yet, b***ing in mind that words tend to mean 'what they've come to mean', we can work ****wards-in a sense-to try to fix certain essentials. Thus, at a very basic level, we can say that **** was/is a subculture best characterised as being part youth rebellion, part artistic statement. It had its high point from 1976 to 1979, and was most visible in Britain and America. It had its primary manifestation in music-and specifically in the disaffected rock and roll of bands like the Sex Pistols and the Clash. Philosophically, it had no 'set agenda' like the hippy movement that preceded it, but nevertheless stood for identifi**** attitudes, among them: an emphasis on negationism (rather than nihilism); a consciousness of class-based politics (with a stress on 'workingclass credibility'); and a belief in spontaneity and 'doing it yourself'.
Because Galland's version founds its way into many oral traditions, "Al***in" has come to constitute its own tale type-ATU 561-in the classification system used by folklorists (although a simpler form is represented by tale type ATU 560, The Magic Ring, which provides the basic intrigue). The tale's basic structure is very close to a fairy tale: a poor young man, with the aid of a magic object, builds a palace more beautiful than that of the king and marries a princess; when he loses them, thanks to a second magic object, he manages to recover everything he has lost. The hero Al***in is described as a bad sort-undisciplined, lazy, and responsible for the death of his father and the misery of his mother. At the beginning, he does no good deed that would qualify him to obtain a magic object or to marry a princess. But he is without hypocrisy; he succeeds, and in the end he becomes good and wise.
As the hills draw n***er, one heeds their wooded sides more than their stone-crowned tops. Those sides loom up so darkly and precipitously that one wishes they would keep their distance, but there is no road by which to escape them. Across a covered bridge one sees a small village huddled between the stream and the vertical slope of Round Mountain, and wonders at the cluster of rotting gambrel roofs bespeaking an ***lier architectural period than that of the neighbouring region. It is not reassuring to see, on a closer glance, that most of the houses are deserted and falling to ruin, and that the broken-steepled church now harbours the one slovenly mercantile establishment of the hamlet. One dreads to trust the tenebrous tunnel of the bridge, yet there is no way to avoid it. Once across, it is hard to prevent the impression of a faint, malign odour about the village street, as of the massed mould and decay of centuries. It is always a relief to get cl*** of the place, and to follow the narrow road around the base of the hills and across the level country beyond till it rejoins the Aylesbury pike. Afterwards one sometimes l***ns that one has been through Dunwich.
